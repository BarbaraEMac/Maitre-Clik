Hi Kik Team!

Here's a demo Clik app to track people as they eat meals around the office.

Demo is live at: http://clik-app.appspot.com.

Goals:
- To reduce the cost of meals.
    Since meals are ordered from WildCraft on a per-person basis,
    it stands to reason that the company can save money by reducing
    the amount of ordered portions.

    If there are X employees at Kik but at most Y, for Y < X, eat
    a particular meal (either of Lunch or Dinner) on average,
    then the number of ordered portions should be reduced to Y.

- To optimize the time meals are delivered.
    If meals are delivered at time T1 but employees are not ready to 
    eat meals until time T2, for T2 > T1, then meals should
    be delivered at time T2.
    
    No one wants to eat a cold meal!

- To test to daily build of Clik code DAILY.
    What better way to test the builds of both the Clik
    mobile app AND the Clik JS code than to get the whole office
    to use them twice / day.

- To expose non-dev employees to Clik on a regular basis.
    People who are not developing on the platform
    should be thoroughly familiar with the benefits
    of the platform + system. Hence, they should use
    the app and platform as often as possible to see
    new changes are they are implemented.
