Hi Kik Team!

Here's a demo Clik app to track people as they eat meals around the office.

Demo is live at: http://clik-app.appspot.com.
Malicious behaviour will not be tolerated!

Goals:
- To reduce the cost of meals.
    Since meals are ordered from WildCraft on a per-person basis,
    it stands to reason that the company can save money by reducing
    the amount of ordered portions.

    If there are X employees at Kik but at most Y, for Y < X, eat
    a particular meal (either of Lunch or Dinner) on average,
    then the number of ordered portions should be reduced to Y.

- To optimize the time meals are delivered.
    If meals are delivered at time T1 but employees are not ready to 
    eat meals until time T2, for T2 > T1, then meals should
    be delivered at time T2.
    
    No one wants to eat a cold meal!

- To test to daily build of Clik code DAILY.
    What better way to test the builds of both the Clik
    mobile app AND the Clik JS code than to get the whole office
    to use them twice / day.

- To expose non-dev employees to Clik on a regular basis.
    People who are not developing on the platform
    should be thoroughly familiar with the benefits
    of the platform + system. Hence, they should use
    the app and platform as often as possible to see
    new changes are they are implemented.

TODOs:
1. Error check input better.
    - Server side
    - Client side

2. Reduce # of ajax calls from client.
    - Can aggregate calls by storing data in JS

3. Update UI. DONE
    - Desktop UI can be beautified.
    - Mobile UI needs to look more like a native app.
    - CSS should be cleaned up.
    - Make entire app look professional.

4. Attach User data (name, uuid, img) to Client obj via prototype.
    - On an event trigger, does the client who triggered the event
    get passed to the listener? 

5. Use memcache more.
    - Memcache Stats obj.
    - Memcache current Meal.

6. Stop default QR code from displaying instead of removing it after in DOM.

7. Write better JS.
    - Encapsulate private fcns & vars.
    - Handle view / state switching better.

8. Complete analytics.
    - Add weekly emailer too so you don't need to view dashboard.
